Yashushi\u2019s teachings of battlefield positioning and outmanoeuvring were amongst the first lessons taught in the Koryu School in Okyo. Kaihime could clearly remember old sensei Goryu drawing the shapes in the sand with his ivory cane. Inviting the students to plan their avenues of attack before clearly and cleanly dissecting the flaws in their tactics, brushing the sand clean and starting again. Hours would seem like minutes to the whole class, captivated by the old man\u2019s wisdom.","\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see the faults of a plan in hindsight, the trick is study so that hindsight becomes foresight,\u201d He had said to her after a long autumn lesson. Her young, wide hazel eyes staring intently, studying the old man\u2019s wizened face with as much concentration as she did his words. Of course this was easier said than done. But like all things in the life of a Bushi she would give her all in the pursuit of mastering it. \u201cKaihime-Sama, the troops are ready,\u201d Spoke the Jade Mamba, knelt at the tent flap, head bowed in obedience. One hand on her standing knee the other on the hilt of her trademark nagamaki sword.","Kaihime turned to look at the young but brave warrior before her and another of Sensei Goryu\u2019s teachings. The responsibility of knowledge and wisdom is to carry it like any gift until those of worth are found to impart it upon. Kaihime felt this was such a time.","\u201cCome here, take off your helmet and listen carefully,\u201d She instructed as she cleared the desk and drew out a parchment of the valley in which they were currently encamped."],"type":"Zone Control","deployment":["Baseline Deployment","Three Zones 4\u201d Diameter (one Friendly, one Neutral, one Enemy)"],"game_length":"Fixed (6)","has_objective_interaction":false,"victory_conditions":{"points":["To the Player who has the most Scenario Points during the End Phase of turn 2","To the Player who has the most Scenario Points during the End Phase of turn 4","To the Player who has the most Scenario Points during the End Phase of turn 6"],"has_additional_rules":false},"image":"ryodo.svg","id":"9CE1C1D5-0387-1CE0-6805-FFC02EDD6D90"},"7EFABC27-790A-A99B-7A23-58F85F86CAC7":{"name":"Seigyo","story":["Harukichi wiped the noodle juice trickling down his chin with a neatly folded and beautifully embroidered silk napkin. His brow furrowed as he listened to the report from the young Shatei knelt before him, head bowed in respect. Karukichi wasn\u2019t a Lord, but to his gumi he was the undisputed leader and he made the decisions.","As the boy told of the Jung warriors\u2019 poorly concealed movements around the old Shrines in the market square of this moderately size port of Katsuyama Harukichi drummed his chubby little fingers upon the exquisitely crafted pummel of his cane. The five gold rings, adorning his fingers, each a tribute to the Fortunes, made the clinking sound members of his gumi had become familiar with when Harukichi was considering his next move. To his right the ever present Manu, his colossal form stood statuesque, only his eyes moved, scanning the buildings and alleys around them for possible danger to his Oyabun. Harukichi felt a certain amount of surprise that the pirates could make such a poor move, to so openly and brazenly challenge the Silvermoon\u2019s expansion of its base of operations was poor business. Harukichi and the leaders of the other gumi would have had no qualms allowing the Jung to continue to use the port to resupply without threat from the Prefecture, for a fair price of course. These Jung fools surely had to know that confronting the Silvermoon would end up costing them more than just the moons lining their purses.","After a good ten minutes of thought, Harukichi let out a small sigh and smiled. He was a business man, but also a gambler, and from what his men had told him he liked the odds. Soon, with the blessing of the Fortunes he would secure the location, the port and more moons for the gumi."],"type":"Scenario Objective","deployment":["Baseline Deployment","3 Scenario Objectives (Small) all Neutral"],"game_length":"Fixed (6)","has_objective_interaction":true,"objective_interaction":["Influence (Simple)"],"victory_conditions":{"points":["To the player with the most Friendly Scenario Objectives at the end of Turn 2","To the player with the most Friendly Scenario Objectives at the end of Turn 4","To the player with the most Friendly Scenario Objectives at the end of Turn 6"],"has_additional_rules":false},"image":"idols-seigyo-omaju.svg","id":"7EFABC27-790A-A99B-7A23-58F85F86CAC7"}},"guides":{"5B99F01A-84D5-5FA0-32B1-44E5A08C0CF4":{"name":"New Dawn Rules","filename":"new_dawn_rules.pdf"},"D61B5562-4145-970C-FEB6-6CA182AEB53F":{"name":"Rules Update and Errata (24\/02\/2015)","filename":"errata_24-02-2015.pdf"},"D18AE127-D8F3-8869-53EA-BD361BAE7F2B":{"name":"Silvermoon Player's Guide","filename":"silvermoon_players_guide.pdf"},"4127ADF0-1E3E-82B7-9911-E236F555FBD3":{"name":"Tournament Pack","filename":"tournament_pack.pdf"}},"settings":{"htmlemailsetting":{"title":"Create HTML emails when sharing Warbands","default":"enabled","id":"htmlemailsetting"},"lexicographicalsort":{"title":"Sort all items in Warband lists alphabetically","default":"disabled","id":"lexicographicalsort"}},"faqs":{"9B86410A-B8AF-E69C-60E2-2A7574F9E845":{"question":"How do I rename a Warband or change its rice limit?","title":"Editing a Warband","content":["On the Warbands screen, swipe left on a Warband's name and tap on the pencil icon (in the blue block).","You can rename the Warband or changes its rice limit - but you cannot change its faction."],"id":"9B86410A-B8AF-E69C-60E2-2A7574F9E845"},"7EB5D207-9B22-3BDF-A348-F772E30527F3":{"question":"How do I delete a Warband?","title":"Deleting a Warband","content":["On the Warbands screen, swipe left on a Warband's name and tap on the trash icon (in the red block).","Tap the &quot;Delete&quot; option in the confirmation dialogue box that appears."],"id":"7EB5D207-9B22-3BDF-A348-F772E30527F3"},"009475D5-A79F-104B-DF54-F4A11F7DA9A5":{"question":"How do I add enhancements to a Warband character","title":"Adding enhancements to a Warband character","content":["On the Warband Characters screen, swipe left on a character's name and tap on the more (...) icon (in the blue block).","Enter the name and the rice cost of the enhancement; previously used enhancements are listed and can be selected from."],"id":"009475D5-A79F-104B-DF54-F4A11F7DA9A5"},"D2F0C66E-D567-18CC-27E6-98973894F444":{"question":"How do I remove a character from a Warband?","title":"Deleting a Warband character","content":["On the Warband Characters screen, swipe left on a character's name and tap on the trash icon (in the red block).","Tap the &quot;Delete&quot; option in the confirmation dialogue box that appears."],"id":"D2F0C66E-D567-18CC-27E6-98973894F444"},"18332EF0-C85E-2698-5170-CC8E617BE639":{"question":"Where are all the other cards?","title":"Cards in the app","content":["This is an unofficial app, not built by GCT Studios (but with their kind permission).","Only freely downloadable content is included.
